# 3.1 Container Networking

In this section, we'll explore Docker networking, including understanding Docker networking, linking containers, and exposing container ports.

- To **creates** a bridge network named "my_network"

  ```bash
  docker network create my_network
  ```

- To **view** the existing networks on your Docker host

  ```bash
  docker network ls
  ```

- And you can **inspect** a specific network, for example, the "bridge" network
  ```bash
  docker network inspect bridge
  ```

## 3.1.1. Understanding Docker networking

### 1. User-Defined Networks:

- **Creation:**
  ```bash
  docker network create my_network
  ```
- **Usage:**
  ```bash
  docker run -d --name=container1 --network=my_network my_image
  docker run -d --name=container2 --network=my_network my_image
  ```
- **Benefits:**
  - Containers on the same network can communicate using container names.
  - Improved isolation and scalability compared to deprecated linking.

### 2. Container Port Mapping

- **Port Mapping:**
  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name=web_app my_web_app_image
  ```
- **Access:**
  Open the web app in a browser at `http://localhost:8080`.
- **Benefits:**
  - Maps host machine ports to container ports for external access.
  - Enables running multiple containers on the same host without port conflicts.

### 3. Modern Bridge Networks

- **Creation:**
  ```bash
  docker network create --driver=bridge --subnet=192.168.1.0/24 --gateway=192.168.1.1 my_custom_network
  ```
- **Usage:**
  ```bash
  docker run -d --name=container1 --network=my_custom_network my_image
  docker run -d --name=container2 --network=my_custom_network my_image
  ```
- **Benefits:**
  - Customize subnet and gateway for more control.
  - Each container gets its own IP address on the network.

## 3.1.2 User-Defined Networks in Docker

#### 1. Creating a User-Defined Network:

- User-defined networks provide a flexible way to connect containers.
- Create a network:
  ```bash
  docker network create my_network
  ```

#### 2. Connecting Containers to a User-Defined Network:

- When running containers, connect them to the created network:
  ```bash
  docker run -d --name=container1 --network=my_network my_image
  docker run -d --name=container2 --network=my_network my_image
  ```
- Containers on the same network can communicate using container names.

#### 3. Customizing Network Settings:

- You can specify additional settings when creating a network:
  ```bash
  docker network create --driver=bridge --subnet=192.168.1.0/24 --gateway=192.168.1.1 my_custom_network
  ```
- This allows you to define the subnet and gateway for more control over the network configuration.

#### 4. Container Communication on User-Defined Networks:

- Containers on the same user-defined network can communicate by referencing container names:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it container1 ping container2
  ```
- The use of container names simplifies communication and avoids the need for explicit IP addresses.

#### 5. Scaling with User-Defined Networks:

- User-defined networks make it easy to scale applications by adding more containers to the same network.
- No need for explicit links; containers discover and communicate with each other by name.

## 3.1.3. Container Port Mapping

### 1. Port Mapping Basics:

- When running a container, you can map ports from the host to the container.
- Example:
  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name=web_app my_web_app_image
  ```
- This maps port 8080 on the host to port 80 on the web_app container.

### 2. Accessing Containers via Mapped Ports:

- Access the containerized service on the host machine:

- Access the web app at http://localhost:8080 in a web browser

### 3. Benefits of Port Mapping:

- **Avoids Port Conflicts:**
  - Enables running multiple containers on the same host without port conflicts.
- **External Access:**
  - Exposes container services to the external world, facilitating interaction.

### 4. Mapping Multiple Ports:

- You can map multiple ports for a container:
  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 8080:80 -p 5000:5000 --name=multi_port_app my_multi_port_image
  ```
- This maps both port 8080 and port 5000 from the host to the corresponding ports in the container.

### 5. Dynamic Port Mapping:

- If you don't specify a host port, Docker can dynamically assign one:
  ```bash
  docker run -d -P --name=dynamic_port_app my_dynamic_port_image
  ```
- Use `docker port` to see the assigned ports:
  ```bash
  docker port dynamic_port_app
  ```

### 6. Port Mapping and Networking:

- Port mapping is often used in conjunction with user-defined networks.
- Containers on the same network can still communicate using internal ports.

## 3.1.4 Differennt Docker network

Docker provides a flexible networking model that allows containers to communicate with each other and with the outside world.

### 1. Bridge Network

- Default network created by Docker.
- Containers on the same bridge network can communicate with each other.
- Each container gets its own IP address on this network.

```bash
# Run two containers on the same bridge network
docker run -d --name=web_app nginx
docker run -d --name=database_server postgres
```

Now, the `web_app` container and `database_server` container can communicate with each other over the default bridge network.

### 2. Host Network

- Containers share the network namespace with the host.
- If you run a container in the **host network mode**, it shares the network namespace with the host.
- This means the container has direct access to the host's network interfaces.

To run a container using the host network, use the `--network host` option:

```bash
# Run a container in host network mode
docker run -d --network=host --name=host_container nginx
```

The `host_container` now has direct access to the host's network interfaces.

### 3. Overlay Network

- For connecting containers across multiple Docker hosts.
- It enables communication between containers running on different hosts.

```bash
# Create an overlay network
docker network create --driver=overlay my_overlay_network

# Run a service attached to the overlay network
docker service create --network=my_overlay_network --name=service_name my_image
```

Now, `service_name` can communicate with other containers in the same overlay network, even if they are on different hosts.

### 4. Macvlan Network

- Assign a MAC address to a container, making it appear as a physical device on your network.
- Containers on a Macvlan network can have IP addresses on your local network.

```bash
# Create a Macvlan network
docker network create -d macvlan --subnet=192.168.1.0/24 --gateway=192.168.1.1 -o parent=eth0 my_macvlan_network

# Run a container on the Macvlan network
docker run -d --network=my_macvlan_network --name=macvlan_container nginx
```

Now, `macvlan_container` has an IP address on your local network.

### 5. Custom Bridge Networks

- You can create your own bridge networks with specific subnets and gateway settings.
- This allows more control over container networking.

```bash
# Create a custom bridge network
docker network create --driver=bridge --subnet=172.18.0.0/16 --gateway=172.18.0.1 my_custom_network

# Run a container on the custom network
docker run -d --network=my_custom_network --name=custom_container nginx
```

### 6. Container Port Mapping

- You can map ports from the host to the container or even specify a specific IP address on the host.

  ```bash
  # Run a container with port mapping
  docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name=port_mapped_container nginx
  ```

  Now, you can access the web server in `port_mapped_container` by visiting http://localhost:8080 on the host machine.
