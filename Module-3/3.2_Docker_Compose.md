# 3.2 Docker Compose

In this section, we'll introduce Docker Compose, covering its basics, defining multi-container applications, and managing multi-container environments.

## 3.2.1 Introduction to Docker Compose

### 1. What is Docker Compose:

[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
It allows you to define the entire application stack, including services, networks, and volumes, in a single file.

### 2. Why Use Docker Compose:

- **Simplified Configuration:**
  - Define all services, their configurations, and relationships in a single YAML file (`docker-compose.yml`)..
- **Easy Orchestration:**
  - One command (`docker-compose up`) can spin up the entire application stack.

### 3. Docker Compose YAML File:

- A `docker-compose.yml` file is used to define the application's services, networks, and volumes.
- Example structure:
  ```yaml
  version: "3"
  services:
  web_app:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
  database:
    image: postgres
  ```

### 4. Defining Services:

- Each service is defined under the services key.
- Specify the image, ports, volumes, environment variables, and other settings for each service.

### 5. Running Docker Compose:

- To start the defined services:

  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```

- To run in detached mode:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

### 5. Scaling Services:

- Easily scale services by specifying the desired number of replicas.
- Example in `docker-compose.yml`:
  ```yaml
  services:
  web_app:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    scale: 3
  ```

### 6. Docker Compose and Networking:

- Services in a Docker Compose file share a default network, allowing easy communication.
- External networks and custom bridge networks can also be defined.

### 7. Stopping and Removing Services:

- **To stop services:**

  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```

- **To remove volumes as well:**
  ```bash
  docker-compose down -v
  ```

## 3.2.2 Defining multi-container applications

#### 1. **Service Definitions in Docker Compose:**

- Docker Compose allows you to define multiple services in a single file (`docker-compose.yml`).
- Each service is defined under the `services` key, specifying the container image, ports, and other configurations.

#### 2. **Dependencies and Volumes:**

- Specify dependencies between services using the `depends_on` key.
- Share volumes between services using the `volumes` key.

#### 3. **Environment Variables:**

- Easily set environment variables for services.
- Example:
  ```yaml
  services:
    web_app:
      image: nginx
      environment:
        - NGINX_PORT=8080
    database:
      image: postgres
      environment:
        - POSTGRES_DB=my_database
  ```

#### 4. **Defining Dependencies Between Services:**

- Ensure services start in the correct order by defining dependencies.
- Example:
  ```yaml
  services:
    web_app:
      image: nginx
      depends_on:
        - database
    database:
      image: postgres
  ```

#### 5. **Sharing Volumes Between Services:**

- Docker Compose allows you to share volumes between services.
- This facilitates data sharing and persistence between containers.
- Example:
  ```yaml
  services:
    web_app:
      image: nginx
      volumes:
        - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html
    database:
      image: postgres
      volumes:
        - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  volumes:
    db_data:
  ```

#### 6. **Scaling Services:**

- Easily scale services by specifying the desired number of replicas.
- Example in `docker-compose.yml`:
  ```yaml
  services:
    web_app:
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - "8080:80"
      scale: 3
  ```

#### 7. **Networks in Docker Compose:**

- By default, services defined in the same Docker Compose file share a default network.
- You can also create custom networks for more complex setups.

#### 8. **Running Docker Compose:**

- Once your `docker-compose.yml` is defined, run the entire multi-container application with a single command:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```

## 3.2.3 Managing multi-container environments with Current Best Practices

#### 1. **Service Health Checks:**

- Use health checks to ensure that services are running properly.
- Example in `docker-compose.yml`:
  ```yaml
  services:
    web_app:
      image: nginx
      healthcheck:
        test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost"]
        interval: 1m
        timeout: 10s
        retries: 3
  ```

#### 2. **Container Restart Policies:**

- Define restart policies to automatically restart failed containers.
- Example:
  ```yaml
  services:
    web_app:
      image: nginx
      restart: always
  ```

#### 3. **Managing Secrets:**

- Docker Compose supports managing secrets for sensitive data.
- Store secrets in an external file and reference them in the `docker-compose.yml`.
- Example:
  ```yaml
  services:
    database:
      image: postgres
      secrets:
        - db_password
  secrets:
    db_password:
      file: ./secrets/db_password.txt
  ```

#### 4. **Configuring Resource Limits:**

- Set resource limits for containers to manage resource consumption.
- Example:
  ```yaml
  services:
    web_app:
      image: nginx
      deploy:
        resources:
          limits:
            cpus: "0.5"
            memory: 512M
  ```

#### 5. **Distributed Applications with Docker Swarm:**

- Docker Compose can deploy multi-container applications to a Docker Swarm.
- Use the `docker stack deploy` command.
- Example:
  ```bash
  docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml my_stack
  ```

#### 6. **Integration with External Tools:**

- Docker Compose integrates with external tools for logging, monitoring, and orchestration.
- Example with Prometheus for monitoring:
  ```yaml
  services:
    prometheus:
      image: prom/prometheus
      volumes:
        - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
  ```

#### 7. **Versioned Compose Files:**

- Specify the version of the `docker-compose.yml` file to ensure compatibility.
- Example:
  ```yaml
  version: "3.8"
  ```
