# 5.1. Docker Security

### 5.1.1. Best Practices for Securing Docker

#### 1. **Introduction to Docker Security:**

- Securing Docker containers is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and protect sensitive data.

#### 2. **Keep Docker Up to Date:**

- Regularly update Docker to benefit from the latest security patches and improvements.
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get upgrade docker-ce
  ```

#### 3. **Use Official Images:**

- Stick to official Docker images from trusted sources.
- Official images are regularly maintained and undergo security checks.

```yaml
services:
  web_app:
    image: nginx:latest
```

#### 4. **Limit Container Capabilities:**

- Use the principle of least privilege.
- Limit container capabilities by removing unnecessary privileges.

```yaml
services:
  web_app:
    cap_drop:
      - NET_RAW
```

#### 5. **Implement Resource Constraints:**

- Set resource constraints to prevent containers from consuming excessive resources.
- Limit CPU and memory usage.

```yaml
services:
  web_app:
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: "0.5"
          memory: 512M
```

#### 6. **Network Segmentation:**

- Use Docker's built-in networking features to segment containers.
- Place containers in isolated networks to reduce the attack surface.

```yaml
services:
  web_app:
    networks:
      - frontend
networks:
  frontend:
```

#### 7. **Secure Docker Daemon:**

- Limit access to the Docker daemon.
- Use TLS for secure communication.
- Restrict remote access to trusted users.

```bash
dockerd --tlsverify --tlscacert=ca.pem --tlscert=cert.pem --tlskey=key.pem -H=0.0.0.0:2376
```

#### 8. **Enable Content Trust:**

- Docker Content Trust ensures the integrity and authenticity of images.

```bash
export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1
```

#### 9. **Regularly Monitor and Audit:**

- Set up monitoring and auditing tools to track container behavior.
- Monitor for unusual activities or security incidents.

#### 10. **Regularly Backup Data:**

- Regularly backup container data and configurations.
- Ensure quick recovery in case of a security incident.

#### 11. **Conclusion:**

- Docker security is an ongoing process.
- Implementing best practices reduces the risk of vulnerabilities and enhances the overall security posture.

### 5.1.2. Docker Content Trust

#### 1. **Introduction to Docker Content Trust (DCT):**

- Docker Content Trust is a security feature that ensures the integrity and authenticity of images.

#### 2. **Enabling Docker Content Trust:**

- DCT can be enabled globally or on a per-repository basis.

- **Globally:**

  ```bash
  export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1
  ```

- **Per-Repository:**
  ```bash
  docker trust init --pull my_repo/my_image
  ```

#### 3. **Signing Images:**

- Before pushing an image, sign it with your private key.
- Use the `docker trust sign` command.

```bash
docker trust sign my_repo/my_image:tag
```

#### 4. **Verification Process:**

- When pulling a signed image, Docker Content Trust verifies the signatures.

- **Successful Verification:**

  ```bash
  Exporting image data
  Signed by
  Subject: CN=Docker Repository Signing Key
  Issuer: CN=Docker Repository Signing CA
  ```

- **Failed Verification:**
  ```bash
  Error: remote trust data does not exist for signed content
  ```

#### 5. **Key Rotation:**

- Rotate keys regularly to enhance security.

- **Rotate Signer Key:**

  ```bash
  docker trust key rotate my_repo/my_image
  ```

- **Rotate Repository Key:**
  ```bash
  docker trust signer rotate my_repo/my_image key_name
  ```

#### 6. **Manage Trusted Collections:**

- View and manage trusted collections with Docker Content Trust.

- **List Trusted Collections:**

  ```bash
  docker trust inspect --pretty my_repo/my_image
  ```

- **Revoke Trust:**
  ```bash
  docker trust revoke my_repo/my_image
  ```

#### 7. **Share Trusted Images:**

- Share the signed image and public key with others to ensure they can verify the authenticity.

- **Export and Share:**

  ```bash
  docker trust export my_repo/my_image --output my_repo_my_image.pub
  ```

- **Import on Another System:**
  ```bash
  docker trust import my_repo_my_image.pub
  ```

#### 8. **Conclusion:**

- Docker Content Trust enhances image security by ensuring only signed and verified images are used.
- Regular key rotation and proper key management are essential for maintaining a secure container environment.
