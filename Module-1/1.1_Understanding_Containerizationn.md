# 1.1 Overview of Containerization

### What is Virtual Machine (VM).?

**Virtual Machine (VM)** is like a computer within a computer. It's a software-based emulation of a physical computer that runs an operating system and applications as if they were on a physical machine. This allows you to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine, making it a versatile tool for testing, development, and running applications in isolated environments. It's like having a **computerception**!

## 1.1.1 What is containerization?

**Containerization** is a lightweight and portable approach to packaging, distributing, and running applications. It involves encapsulating an application and its dependencies into a container, ensuring consistency across different environments.

### Key Concepts:

- **Container**: An isolated environment containing an application and its dependencies.
- **Image**: A lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software.

## 1.1.2 Docker vs. traditional virtualization

- Traditional virtualization involves running multiple operating systems on a single physical machine using a **hypervisor** (eg - Oracle Virtual Machine, etc.).
- In contrast, Docker uses **containerization** to virtualize the operating system, making it more efficient and lightweight.

### Docker Advantages:

- Faster deployment.
- Efficient resource utilization.
- Consistent environments.

## 1.1.3 Benefits of using Docker

Docker offers several advantages for software development and deployment:

- **Isolation:** Containers encapsulate applications and dependencies, preventing conflicts.
- **Portability:** Consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- **Scalability:** Easily scale applications by running multiple containers.

## 1.1.4. Docker Workflow

- Developers write Dockerfiles to define containerized applications.
- Docker Engine builds images from Dockerfiles.
- Docker Hub serves as a repository for sharing and pulling Docker images.
- Docker Compose orchestrates the deployment of multi-container applications.

### 1.2.4 Use Cases for Docker

Docker is a versatile tool with applications across various scenarios.

#### **Development Environments:**

- Ensures consistent setups with Dockerfiles.
- Eliminates "it works on my machine" issues.

#### **CI/CD:**

- Standardized, reproducible environments.
- Speeds up releases through containerized pipelines.

#### **Microservices:**

- Independent development, testing, and scaling.
- Promotes agility in microservices architecture.

#### **Other Use Cases:**

- **Testing and QA:**
  - Efficient, isolated testing environments.
- **Legacy App Modernization:**
  - Portable, scalable legacy applications.
- **Scaling:**
  - Lightweight, easy horizontal scaling.

#### Core Concepts:

- **Containers:** Lightweight, standalone, and executable packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.

- **Images:** A snapshot or a template of a container. It's a lightweight, stand-alone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.

- **Dockerfile:** A script that contains instructions for building a Docker image. It defines the base image to use, any additional components or customization, and the commands needed to run the application.
