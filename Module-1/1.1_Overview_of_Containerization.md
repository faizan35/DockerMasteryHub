# 1.1 Overview of Containerization

To understand **Docker**, we have to first understand few things.

### What is Virtual Machine (VM).?

**Virtual Machine (VM)** is like a computer within a computer. It's a software-based emulation of a physical computer that runs an operating system and applications as if they were on a physical machine. This allows you to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine, making it a versatile tool for testing, development, and running applications in isolated environments. It's like having a computerception!

### 1.1.1 What is Containerization.?

**Containerization** is a lightweight and involves encapsulating (or packaging) an application and its dependencies into a container, providing an isolated and consistent environment across different computing environments.

#### Differences from Virtual Machines (VMs):

- Containers share the host OS kernel, making them more lightweight.
- Containers start quickly and consume fewer resources compared to VMs.

### 1.1.2 Advantages of Containerization

**Efficiency:**

- Containers use fewer resources and have a smaller footprint compared to traditional deployment methods.

**Scalability:**

- Easily scale applications up or down by deploying multiple containers.

**Isolation:**

- Containers isolate applications, preventing conflicts between dependencies.

### 1.1.3 Comparison with Virtualization

**Resource Utilization:**

- Containers utilize resources more efficiently by sharing the host OS kernel.

**Performance:**

- Containers provide faster startup times and improved performance compared to VMs.

**Deployment Speed:**

- Containers can be deployed rapidly, reducing time-to-market for applications.

Understanding these concepts is crucial for harnessing the full potential of containerization in Docker.
