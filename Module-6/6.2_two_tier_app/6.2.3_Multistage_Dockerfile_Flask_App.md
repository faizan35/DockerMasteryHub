# 6.2.3 Multistage Dockerfile - Flask App

## Reducing Size of Docker image with - Multi-Stage Docker Build

This demonstrates the use of a multistage Dockerfile to build and package a Flask backend application. Multistage builds are used to optimize the final Docker image size and improve security.

## Why we need multi-stage docker build?

To reduce size.

```

## Steps for Setup

1. Dockerfile

- Before

  ```dockerfile
  FROM python:3.9

  WORKDIR /app

  COPY backend/ /app

  RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

  EXPOSE 5000

  CMD ["python", "app.py"]
  ```

- After -> multi stage

### Steps

- Stage 1
  - Give "Base" a name followed by `AS`
- Stage 2
  - Google search or use chatGPT to find out "python base image least size". eg - `python:3.9-slim`
  - use this small image
  - It will remove the intermediate container and will use the container made with small image.

```dockerfile
# ------------------- Stage 1: Build Stage ------------------------
FROM python:3.9 AS backend-builder

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the contents of the backend directory into the container at /app
COPY backend/ .

# Install dependencies specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# ------------------- Stage 2: Final Stage ------------------------

# Use a slim Python 3.9 image as the final base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the built dependencies from the backend-builder stage
COPY --from=backend-builder /usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/ /usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/

# Copy the application code from the backend-builder stage
COPY --from=backend-builder /app /app

# Expose port 5000 for the Flask application
# remember this dose not do anything its like documentations
# when you execute the run command with -p 5000:5000 this defines the port
EXPOSE 5000

# Define the default command to run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

2. Build and Run

```bash
docker build -t multi-stage .
```

```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 multi-stage:latest
```

## Explanations

#### 1. Location of Python Packages:

- When you install Python packages using pip in a Docker image, they are typically installed in the `/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/` directory.
- This is the default location where Python packages are installed on many Linux systems.

#### 2. Copying Dependencies:

- The goal of this line is to copy the installed dependencies from the backend-builder stage to the final image.
- By copying the contents of `/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/`, you are bringing in all the installed Python packages.

#### 3. Slimming Down the Final Image:

- The use of multi-stage builds is often employed to reduce the size of the final Docker image.
- By copying just the necessary dependencies, you avoid including unnecessary build artifacts and files that are not needed for the runtime of your application.

#### 4. Compatibility:

- This approach assumes that the Python packages installed in the backend-builder stage are compatible with the slimmer base image used in the final stage (`python:3.9-slim`).
- The copying is done from the full Python image to the slim image to ensure compatibility.
