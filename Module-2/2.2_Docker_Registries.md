# 2.2 Docker Registries

In this section, we'll explore Docker registries, including an introduction to Docker Hub, pushing and pulling images, and setting up private registries.

## 2.2.1 Introduction to Docker Hub

[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) is a cloud-based registry service provided by Docker for sharing and managing Docker images. It serves as a central repository for storing and distributing Docker images.

To push an image to Docker Hub, follow these steps:

1. Log in to Docker Hub using the `docker login` command:

```bash
docker login
```

1. Tag your local image with your Docker Hub username and repository name:

```bash
docker tag my-node-app your-username/my-node-app
```

3. Push the image to Docker Hub:

```bash
docker push your-username/my-node-app
```

## 2.2.2 Pushing and pulling images

Pushing and pulling images is essential for sharing and distributing containers between different environments.

- To push an image to a registry, use the `docker push` command:

  ```bash
  docker push your-registry/your-image
  ```

the first command `docker push your-username/my-node-app` assumes you're pushing to your personal Docker Hub account, while `docker push your-registry/your-image` command allows you to push to a more customizable registry.

- To pull an image from a registry, use the `docker pull` command:

  ```bash
  docker pull your-registry/your-image
  ```

## 2.2.3 Private registries and their setup

For scenarios where you need to host private Docker images, you can set up a private registry.

To create a private registry using Docker, follow these steps:

1. Run a registry container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name registry registry
```

2. Tag your local image for the private registry:

```bash
docker tag my-node-app localhost:5000/my-node-app
```

3. Push the image to the private registry:

```bash
docker push localhost:5000/my-node-app
```
